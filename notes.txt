master IP: 192.168.87.10
node IP: 192.168.87.11

convenience remove of known hosts:
ssh-keygen -R 192.168.87.10 && ssh-keygen -R 192.168.87.11

Steps from http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/gettingstarted/

`sudo chcon -Rvt svirt_sandbox_file_t /var/lib/local-registry` -> this fails unless you do it after creating and starting the service

`KUBE_ETCD_SERVERS="--etcd_servers=http://192.168.87.10:2379"` -> moved this line to /etc/kubernets/apiserver

Issue: after restarting the node, the fixed private IP wasn't working to SSH in. Restarting the network service after using "vagrant ssh node" to reach the box fixed this.

had to put SELinux into permissive mode to get DNS working

DNS working steps

- kubelet config and restart Service
- start DNS Service
- start DNS RC
