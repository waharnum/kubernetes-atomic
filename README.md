# What's This?

A fragile Ansible-based handroll of setting up Kubernetes on CentOS Atomic as described at http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/gettingstarted/, plus setting up the DNS add-on

Not production-ready but helpful in getting an Atomic-based local cluster up quickly for experimentation.

Currently sets up a single master and node, working on making it more configurable.
